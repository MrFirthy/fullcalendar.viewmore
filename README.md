# "View More Button" Plugin for [FullCalendar][0]

This code was written by [Scott Greenfield][1] of [Lyconic][2] to address issue [#304][3].

I was looking at the list of issues for FullCalendar on Google Code, and I realized that, 
out of neccesity for a company project, I had solved several of them. Anyway, I figured 
I'd start with the most "starred" enhancement, the "view more" button.

Tutorial and refactored code coming soon!
